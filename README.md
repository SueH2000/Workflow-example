 The Fasta parser
     This is a program that writes a parser that reads the GeneticData â€“1.txt file and outputs two fasta files, one for mtDNA and one for the Y chromosome.
 Usage:
     python FastaParser.py text_file output_fasta_file

Multiple sequence alignments
    This is a program that 
    1. Reads an aligned fasta file.
    2. Evaluate the alignment and output two measures of the alignment quality: 
        the identity score and the alignment score of all possible pairs. 
    3. It also allows the user to determine the weight matrix. 
       
Usage:
    python MSA.py -f fasta_file(change the name according to the input data) -p weight_parameters(input from the user) -o output_file(don't forget to change name   according to the infile')
